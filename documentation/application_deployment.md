# Deployment of Medical Applications

Each VM hosts a separate medical system:

- **vm-kspps** → KS‑PPS (Kamed)
- **vm-rejestracja** → e‑Rejestracja
- **vm-gabinet** → Gabinet.gov.pl

Applications were deployed by:
1. Uploading application files to IIS directory
2. Configuring bindings (HTTPS)
3. Verifying service availability
4. Testing connectivity from clinic workstations
