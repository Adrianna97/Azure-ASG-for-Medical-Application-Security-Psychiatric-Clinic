# GDPR Compliance Considerations

This project improves GDPR compliance by:

- Eliminating IP-based filtering (error-prone)
- Enforcing least privilege access
- Isolating medical applications
- Reducing risk of accidental exposure
- Ensuring encrypted communication (HTTPS)
- Centralizing security policy management

ASG + NSG architecture supports confidentiality, integrity, and controlled access to patient data.
