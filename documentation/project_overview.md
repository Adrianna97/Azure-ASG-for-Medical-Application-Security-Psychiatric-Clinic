# Project Overview — Application Security Groups (ASG) for Medical Applications

This project implements Application Security Groups (ASG) in Microsoft Azure to secure three medical applications used by the Mental Health Clinic in Wałcz County:

- KS‑PPS (Kamed)
- e‑Rejestracja
- Gabinet.gov.pl

The goal was to replace IP‑based filtering with logical segmentation using ASG and NSG, improving security, scalability, and GDPR compliance.

The environment operates in a hybrid model (on‑prem + Azure), requiring a unified and maintainable security architecture.

Key outcomes:

- Logical segmentation of traffic
- Reduced administrative overhead
- Stronger protection of patient data
- Simplified onboarding of new VMs
- Full alignment with GDPR requirements
